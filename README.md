#### Installation 

It is not necessary to install any libraries outside of the Anaconda suit of python. Everything is built in Python 3. version only.
The platform should also include all dependecies for running spark ML algorithms and data exploration functions

#### Project Overview 

This project is to mainly deal with the customer churn for a music app called Sparkify. This is part of UDACITY nanodegree capstone project.

In this project, i have used PySpark along with other basic python packages to identify the key features for calling out the customer churn

#### File Descriptions 

User activity dataset â€” The dataset logs user demographic information (e.g. user name, gender etc.,) and activity (e.g. song listened, event type, device.thumbs up, thumb down, downgrade done etc.,) at individual timestamps.

A small subset (~120MB) of the full dataset was used for exploratory data analysis and machine learning model development.

#### Approach

Have gone through the basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand the data, finalize the features to be included.

Post the feature selection, have prepared and checked multiple models to see the f1 score and considered the best among them.

#### Results 

A quick summary of this project has been written in a [blogpost](https://medium.com/@devanand.mukka/sparkify-predict-customer-churn-for-a-music-app-322560fcfa24)
